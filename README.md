## What did I learn and think about this project
It is a showcase on how quick I can transform mockups to markup. I didn't use TailwindCSS because I couldn't make use of the default classes since I had to deliver a "pixel perfect" markup. So instead of adjusting TailwindCSS I decided to go for a SCSS reset and rem reset. I also added some features, I made it responsive and added a CSS only burger menu (created by myself) and a CSS only slider (also created by myself).
