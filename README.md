## What did I learn and think about this project
It is a showcase on how quick I can transform mockups to markup. I didn't use TailwindCSS because I couldn't make use of the default classes since I had to deliver a "pixel perfect" markup. So instead of adjusting TailwindCSS I decided to go for a SCSS reset and rem reset. I also added some features, I made it responsive and added a CSS only burger menu (created by myself) and a CSS only slider (also created by myself).

I was a bit "handycapped" since I had to work with Affinity Photo and GIMP but got a PSD created in Photoshop. But later one I remebered that I can also open it with the Mac Preview, so I could do some later adjustments.

I would also like to adjust that it is better to use svg images for icons instead of pixel graphics. But I did not want to spend time to remake the Logo in Affinity Designer or Adobe Illustrator without even knowing the font name. So I only used PNGs. The exact task was to deliver a pixel perfect result not a vector perfect result which also led to this decision.

I was also able to spot a bug within Google Chrome using the backdrop-filter:
